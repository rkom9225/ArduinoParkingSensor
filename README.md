# ArduinoParkingSensor

This is an Arduino-based implementation of a parking sensor (or more generally, a distance sensor, which may be useful for other things as well).

## Hardware

The components (at this stage, will most likely change down the line) for the initial prototype:

- Arduino R4 Minima
- HY-SRF05 Precision Ultrasonic Sensor
- TM1637 4-Digit 7-Segment Display
- Red & Green LEDs for signalling
- Mallory Sonalert PT-2745WQ Piezo buzzer

An R4 Minima was used for the development, but it can be executed on other compatible boards effortlessly, as long as the assigned pins are updated to match your physical connections.
As it is still in the breadboard stage, it will likely be transferred to an Arduino Nano or similar smaller footprint device for 'live' usage.

## Implementation 

The main loop of the program will consistently ping the HY-SRF05 sensor approximately every 60 ms. Specifically, it will send a 10 Âµs pulse on the trigger pin, wait for an interrupt
on the echo pin and if it is high, begin timing the duration of the pulse. The length of the echo pulse is then converted to a distance reading.
A simple circular buffer moving average filter is implemented that averages out the last 50 readings for more stable measurement.

Signalling relies on a pair of LED diodes, a 7 segment display and a piezo buzzer. An ideal parking distance is defined, within which the green LED will light
to signify that the car is in the correct location (not too far and not too close), at this point the display will also output '-OK-'. At other times, the red
LED and piezo buzzer will blink/beep in proportion to the distance (the closer to the sensor the more frequently), while the 7 segment display will show the distance
reading from the sensor.

Controlling the 7-segment display relies on the TM1637 library, other interfacing was implemented manually.
